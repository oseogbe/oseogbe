- 👋 Hi there, I’m a full-stack developer (back-end heavy) with 4-years industry experience architecting and building modular, scalable, secure and performant microservices and web applications.
- 👀 My stack includes Node, Express, PHP, Laravel, Python, React, Next and Vue.
- ☁️ I’ve worked extensively with the AWS cloud provider integrating services like EC2, Lambda, S3, RDS, ELB, SQS and others.
- 🌱 You can take a look at some of my projects at https://osecodes.vercel.app
